	- "Only use quantitative methods in the absence of qualitative insights"
	- "Prefer qualitative insights over quantitative methods"

- If you measure quantity and aim for "more (or less) of the same", the reward function of the system you build lacks nuances. Because [[Every system has a bottleneck on which efforts should be focused when trying to improve the system]] and bottlenecks of "the same system" at 10x scale are different, the measures are also likely to change again.

- Legibility is an attribute of a system. It describes how easy it is to find out about the state of a system. [[Legibility is a precondition for control over a system]].

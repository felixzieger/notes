- I am convinced that these forces to shape the world more than what I see is commonly acknowledged:
	- To the extend that people care about or depend on something, only governance models that ensure incentives stay aligned well enough are tolerated.
		- [[The more I care about something, the less I tolerate the possibility of changing incentives of someone with power over the things supply chain]] and thus I'm bullish on Nostr and Bitcoin.
		- For established categories of B2B software, open-core/open-source is taking over in the long run.
	- With the ascend of AI assistants, we will see a reduction in average organisation head count. Removing friction for individual productivity is becoming an even bigger lever going forward.
		- [[AI is reducing the returns on organisation size]]
	- Every advantage of defensive technologies over offensive technologies makes the world a bit better by shifting the world towards more persuasion.
		- [[Lower returns on violence lead to more sovereignty]]. [[Force, deception, and persuasion are the three ways to wield power]].

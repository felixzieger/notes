- Happiness is found now.
  When something has a prerequisite and lies in the future it's not happiness, it's a conjecture about how we can reach happiness that is flawed because we don't recognize that the only place we can find happiness is now.
- If someones says "before I work on what I truly want to work on, I have to earn X€s" they have a deferred life plan. The problem is that you are not committed. You are not fully into what you think you want to do.
- "Happyness is not found outside of yourself."

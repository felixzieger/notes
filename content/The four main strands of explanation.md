In [[The Fabric of Reality]], David Deutsch lays out that the for main strands of explanation through which we seek to understand the fabric of reality are
	- *quantum theory*,
	- the *theory of evolution*,
	- *epistemology* (the theory of knowledge) and
	- the *theory of computation* (about computers and what they can and cannot, in principle, compute).

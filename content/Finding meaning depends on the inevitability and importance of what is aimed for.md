- Paraphrased from an idea I found in an interview with Peter Thiel. The formulation there was more along the lines of "Meaning is found in doing things that are important, that otherwise wouldn't get done."

- If you think about "what would happen without you doing it" (inevitability) ,you can rephrase this as "Your life becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depths of the responsibility you are willing to shoulder."

	- Counter point by Johanna: Just because you don't take reponsibility, doesn't mean no one will, which is implied by inevitablity.

	- “Your job, throughout your entire life, is to disappoint as many people as it takes to avoid disappointing yourself.”
	- “You can do it like it’s a great weight on you or you can do it like it’s part of the dance.”

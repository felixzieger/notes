- Bitcoin is a simple protocol that does a job.
- One could argue that expanding the protocol would make a better protocol. The Bitcoin community has not followed these arguments to their logical conclusions, but instead kept the protocol simple. [[The reluctance of the Bitcoin community to change Bitcoin is one of its core strengths]]
- Looking at the natural world, the patterns that make up the lower levels, are simple, yet everywhere.
	- Plankton
	- Bacteria
	- DNA
- Our brains are made up of simple cells that are connected. [[High-level simplicity can emerge from low-level complexity]].
- Once a simple pattern (where a pattern embodies an explanation) with enough reach is found, systems built out of simple patterns emerge.
- Simple patterns have fewer failure modes.

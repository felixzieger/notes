- "Jobs to be Done" (JTBD) theory that suggests users "hire" products to perform a specific "job" or meet a need for them.
- It provides an evaluation criterion for design decisions behind a product or service. Thus it sets you up to come up with good explanations because every argument in there can be connected back to the JBTD Theory. [[Good Explanations are hard to vary]]
	- How does this element connect to the job to be done?
- Such theories serve as Axioms in our explanations around good design.
- For example, a user might "hire" a platform like Instagram to share their 
  life's moments visually, or use LinkedIn to network professionally.
- Let’s look at it in the context of social media apps:
	- **Identify the Job:**
	  Understand what tasks or needs your users are trying to fulfill using 
	  your social media platform. This could be accomplished through user 
	  feedback, surveys, or studying user behavior and interactions.
	- **Define the Job:**
	  Clearly state the job in a way that captures its essence. Instead of 
	  saying "post a status", say "connect with friends by sharing life 
	  updates".
	- **Design for the Job:** Consider the functional aspects of the job, as well as the emotional and social context for the user.

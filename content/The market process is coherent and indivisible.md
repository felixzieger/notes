- Quote from Mises as stated [here](https://mises.org/mises-wire/market-process-indivisible-and-logically-interdependent):
	- > The market process is coherent and indivisible. It is an indissoluble intertwinement of actions and reactions, of moves and countermoves. But the insufficiency of our mental abilities enjoins upon us the necessity of dividing it into parts and analyzing each of these parts separately.
- The distributions of income is connected to the overall productivity of an economy. You can't freely adjust one without affecting the other.

- Why is it important that markets function?
	- We get aggregated data about what people value. [[Prices are the outcome of a decentralised discovery process]].
	- We get aggregated information on the viability of ideas. Quoting BasedBeffJezos on [twitter](https://x.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1822490079694401643)
	- > Markets are a feedback mechanism over the space of ideas.

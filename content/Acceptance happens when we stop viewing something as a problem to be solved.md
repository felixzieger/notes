- Meditators realize that everything is already there and there is no need to change
	- A powerful experience during meditation is when my mind calms down for a few seconds and I realize that all experiences that I have ever had, all feelings, thoughts, sounds, sensations have appeared and disappeared. And what is constant is my consciousness.

But I’ve also taken some wisdom from Adam Savage over in *MythBusters*-land and have shifted how I frame that same relationship when talking to patrons: “Let’s not look at this as a problem to be solved; more like a process to be managed.

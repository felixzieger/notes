- Nothing stands still, entropy know only one direction. Even systems that seem "stable" are changing imperceptibly over time.
- Without error correction mechanisms accumulating errors will reach a point at which some assumptions about stocks and flows in the system do not hold anymore, and it gets out of balance.
- Complex systems embody explanations. "Error correction" is the term for criticism and conjecture for complex systems. [[We create better explanations through conjecture, criticism and testing]].

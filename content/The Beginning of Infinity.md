- Spaceship Earth metaphor
	- "The biosphere is a life-support system for humans."
	- Wrong because
	- > There *is* a life-support system in Oxfordshire today, but it was not provided by the biosphere. It has been built by humans. It consists of clothes, houses, farms, hospitals, an electrical grid, a sewage system and so on. Nearly the whole of the Earth’s biosphere in its primeval state was likewise incapable of keeping an unprotected human alive for long.
	- See [[Production is not a given. It's people doing work]]
- Principle of Mediocrity
	- "There is nothing significant about humans".
	- Wrong because humans are universal explainers.

> In the 18th century, British economist Thomas Malthus predicted that population growth would inevitably outpace food production, leading to widespread famine. What Malthus couldn’t foresee was the stunning acceleration in agricultural productivity ushered in by the Industrial Revolution. New machinery, fertilizers, and improved crop varieties would radically increase yields.

> But more transformative than these innovations themselves was their dissemination. Innovations have to spread before they can matter. And in a sense, the history of progress has less to do with the invention of good ideas than with their propagation. The Malthusian trap was escaped by supply chains, infrastructure, literacy, trade, and incentives. Malthus underestimated not innovation, but distribution.

> If the true bottleneck is distribution, then the best long-term investments are not in creating more stuff, but in building the pipes through which stuff flows. Which largely means infrastructure: physical, digital, institutional. Roads, fiber, satellites, schools, legal systems, and trust architectures. These are not glamorous. They do not produce headlines. But they determine whether progress trickles or floods.
